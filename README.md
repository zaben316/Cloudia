A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

In a team of 3, myself and my teammates put together a solution called Scotiahub. Scotiahub consisted of cost-saving branches that allowed for a simplified online banking experience. Integrated with an interactive voice assistant, the scotiahub promotes equality amongst a diverse pool of clients. The ScotiaHub will consist of several tablets that will be integrated with an all new UI that makes it easier than ever to access. Tablets will allow for instant bill payments, void check printing, depositing checks, and many other frequent tasks that cant be done through an ATM machine.
